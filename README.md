# A CookBook of stories

An animated webcomic, running on top of the phaser game engine.

## Why phaser?

This webcomic, as it is mentioned below, runs on phaser, and the reson for it,
is basically nothing, it runs on phaser because we could do it.

## Customizability

The images in this website are of the same size,
both in width, and height. the naming of the images
should be the same, with unique numbers starting from 10,
as it is easier to loop through them that way.

The image names use a format like it can be seen ("FRAMES_0000"), most animating softwares use naming systems like this.

The constant values can be modified to personalize them.
